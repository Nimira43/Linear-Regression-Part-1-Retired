# Linear Regression Basics

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. It's a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting the value of a continous target variable based on one or more input features.

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning algorithms use patterns and inference to improve their performance over time.

Here are some key points about machine learning:

Learning from Data: Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets to identify patterns and make decisions. The more data they process, the better they become at making accurate predictions1.

Types of Learning: There are several types of machine learning, including:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input comes with the correct output. More on this later.

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it, and it must find patterns and relationships on its own.

Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

Applications: Machine learning is used in various fields such as healthcare (predicting disease outbreaks), finance (fraud detection), marketing (customer segmentation), and many more.

### What is a supervised learning algoithm?

A supervised learning algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm that is trained on labeled data. This means that the training data includes both the input features and the corresponding correct output. The algorithm learns to map the input to the output by identifying patterns in the data. Here are some key points about supervised learning algorithms:

Labeled Data: The training data consists of input-output pairs. For example, in a dataset used to predict house prices, the input features might include the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location, while the output would be the price of the house.

Training Process: The algorithm uses the labeled data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output. It adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outputs.

Types of Problems: Supervised learning can be used for two main types of problems:

Classification: The algorithm assigns input data to predefined categories. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

Regression: The algorithm predicts a continuous value. For 
example, predicting the price of a house based on its features.

Common Algorithms: Some popular supervised learning algorithms include:

Linear Regression: Used for regression problems.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.
Decision Trees: Used for both classification and regression problems.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for classification problems.

Supervised learning is widely used in various applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.
