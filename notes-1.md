# Linear Regression Basics

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. It's a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting the value of a continous target variable based on one or more input features.

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning algorithms use patterns and inference to improve their performance over time.

Here are some key points about machine learning:

Learning from Data: Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets to identify patterns and make decisions. The more data they process, the better they become at making accurate predictions1.

Types of Learning: There are several types of machine learning, including:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input comes with the correct output.

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it, and it must find patterns and relationships on its own.

Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

Applications: Machine learning is used in various fields such as healthcare (predicting disease outbreaks), finance (fraud detection), marketing (customer segmentation), and many more.
