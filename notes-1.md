# Linear Regression Basics

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. It's a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting the value of a continous target variable based on one or more input features.

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning algorithms use patterns and inference to improve their performance over time.

Here are some key points about machine learning:

Learning from Data: Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets to identify patterns and make decisions. The more data they process, the better they become at making accurate predictions1.

Types of Learning: There are several types of machine learning, including:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input comes with the correct output. More on this later.

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it, and it must find patterns and relationships on its own.

Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

Applications: Machine learning is used in various fields such as healthcare (predicting disease outbreaks), finance (fraud detection), marketing (customer segmentation), and many more.

### What is a supervised learning algoithm?

A supervised learning algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm that is trained on labeled data. This means that the training data includes both the input features and the corresponding correct output. The algorithm learns to map the input to the output by identifying patterns in the data. Here are some key points about supervised learning algorithms:

Labeled Data: The training data consists of input-output pairs. For example, in a dataset used to predict house prices, the input features might include the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location, while the output would be the price of the house.

Training Process: The algorithm uses the labeled data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output. It adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outputs.

Types of Problems: Supervised learning can be used for two main types of problems:

Classification: The algorithm assigns input data to predefined categories. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

Regression: The algorithm predicts a continuous value. For 
example, predicting the price of a house based on its features.

Common Algorithms: Some popular supervised learning algorithms include:

Linear Regression: Used for regression problems.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.
Decision Trees: Used for both classification and regression problems.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for classification problems.

Supervised learning is widely used in various applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.

### What exactly is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Here are some key points about linear regression:

#### Simple Linear Regression 

This involves one independent variable and one dependent variable. The relationship is modeled by a straight line, represented by the equation:

y=mx+c

where ( y ) is the dependent variable, ( x ) is the independent variable, ( m ) is the slope of the line, and ( c ) is the y-intercept.

#### Multiple Linear Regression 

This involves two or more independent variables. The equation extends to:

y = b0 ​+ b1 ​x 1 ​+ b2 ​x 2​+ … +bn​xn​

where ( y ) is the dependent variable, ( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n ) are the independent variables, and ( b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n ) are the coefficients.

## Multiple Linear Regression Example Scenario

Imagine you’re a public health researcher interested in understanding the factors that influence heart disease rates in different towns. You collect data from 500 towns, including:

The percentage of people who smoke in each town.

The percentage of people who bike to work in each town.

The percentage of people who have heart disease in each town.

### Multiple Linear Regression Model

You want to use multiple linear regression to analyze how smoking and biking to work (independent variables) affect heart disease rates (dependent variable).
The multiple linear regression equation would look like this:

y^​=b0​+b1​x1​+b2​x2​

where:

( \hat{y} ) is the predicted percentage of people with heart disease.

( b_0 ) is the intercept.

( b_1 ) is the coefficient for the percentage of smokers (( x_1 )).

( b_2 ) is the coefficient for the percentage of people who bike to work (( x_2 )).

### Interpreting the Results

After running the regression analysis, you might get an equation like:

y^​=5+0.1x1​−0.05x2​

This means:

The intercept ( b_0 ) is 5, indicating the baseline percentage of heart disease when both ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are zero.

The coefficient ( b_1 ) is 0.1, suggesting that for each 1% increase in smokers, the heart disease rate increases by 0.1%.

The coefficient ( b_2 ) is -0.05, indicating that for each 1% increase in people biking to work, the heart disease rate decreases by 0.05%.

### Visualization

Visualizing multiple linear regression can be more complex than simple linear regression. You might use:

3D plots to show the relationship between the three variables.
Contour plots to represent the predicted values on a 2D plane.

## What is Line, Linear, Graph?

In the context of machine learning, when you mention “Line,” “Linear,” and “Graph,” you’re likely referring to concepts related to linear regression and visualization.

### Line 

This usually refers to the straight line that represents the relationship between variables in a linear regression model. The line is defined by the equation ( y = mx + b ), where ( m ) is the slope and ( b ) is the y-intercept.

### Linear

This term is often used to describe relationships or models that assume a linear relationship between input variables (features) and the output variable (target). Linear regression is a common example, where the goal is to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points.

### Graph: 

In this context, a graph typically refers to a visual representation of data. For linear regression, this would be a scatter plot of the data points with the regression line plotted to show the relationship between the variables1
